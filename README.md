Project One: Contact, Task, and Appointment Management Services

Overview
This project is part of my coursework in Computer Science and focuses on building a basic backend service for managing contacts, tasks, and appointments using Java. It follows a modular approach with unit testing to ensure each service performs as expected.

Each of the following services is implemented separately:
- Contact Service
- Task Service
- Appointment Service

Features
- ContactService: Create, update, and delete contact records with fields such as name, phone number, and address.
- TaskService: Manage to-do tasks with unique IDs, descriptions, and deadlines.
- AppointmentService: Schedule and update appointment data including IDs, dates, and descriptions.

Testing
Each service module includes JUnit test files to validate functionality and ensure business rules are met. You can run the tests using your IDE's built-in test runner.

Example test files:
- ContactServiceTest.java
- TaskServiceTest.java
- AppointmentServiceTest.java
